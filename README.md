# TestingLatencies

I used python3.12

Provided a requirements.txt file to reproduce the environment in case any issues happen during runs.

## Task
The task is to establish 5 connections with Binance using websocket and collect messages latencies. Collect the ratios of fast connections (freequency of connection getting the message first of all connections). Make statistical tests on Mean and Variance and explain the results.
